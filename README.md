Background Subtraction - 

Background subtraction is a fundamental technique in computer vision and image processing used to separate foreground objects from the background in a video or image sequence. 
It plays a crucial role in applications such as object tracking, activity recognition, and surveillance systems.

The goal of background subtraction is to identify the pixels or regions that belong to the stationary background, which can be later classified as the foreground objects. 
It relies on the assumption that the background is relatively static while the foreground objects are dynamic and exhibit motion.
